            Hi, I'm Theophilus Ajiri Menor, I am from Nigeria and a student in WDD 130 (BYU-Idaho). Currently, I am
            learning web development
            and design. <br><br> I love to travel, explore new places, and meet new people. <br> I also enjoy reading
            books,
            especially
            tech related and self-help books. <br> In my free time, I like to watch football and listen to music.
            <br><br> I
            am excited to be a part of this course and
            look forward to learning more about web development and design.
